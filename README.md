## Project Description:
In this project, a calculator has been created that allows performing mathematical operations with numbers. This calculator is adaptable and suitable for various devices, including computers, tablets, and mobile devices. The calculator is developed using the following technologies and methodologies:

## Roles and Features:

+ User:

## Technologies Used:
+ Front-End:

    +HTML - Used for creating the structure of web pages. HTML structure is created following the BEM methodology (Block-Element-Modifier) to maintain clear and understandable code.

    + CSS - Used for styling the website and customizing its appearance. The use of the BEM methodology helps manage classes and style definitions, making the CSS code maintainable and adaptable.

+ Back-End:

    + JavaScript - Used to add functionality to the calculator.
    + XAMPP - Used to create a local development environment and run the server.
